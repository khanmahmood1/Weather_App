# Weather_App 
<br>
It is my first programming it is mainly used Tkinter and API

1. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a Python tool for making graphical interfaces.

2. **API**: An API helps your program talk to the internet.

Here's what my code does:
- It shows a screen where you choose an Indian state.
- you can also type manually your city, state names like London, Mumbai, California tec.
- When you click "Done," it asks the internet for that state's weather.
- Then, it displays the weather information like sunny or rainy, temperature, and air pressure.
